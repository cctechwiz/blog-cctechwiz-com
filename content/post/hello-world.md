My name is Josh Maxwell, this is my personal blog about my journey in DevX, DevOps, and Software Engineering. There will be other topics posted here as well I'm a hobby Homelabber and Game Developer and avid reader so I'll most likely discuss those things from time to time as well. Overall this will be a place for future Josh to reference back to the things I've learned, hopefully you can learn something too.
