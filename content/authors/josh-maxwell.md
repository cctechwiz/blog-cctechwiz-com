## Who am I?

Hi, I am Josh Maxwell, also known online as CCTechWiz. My pronouns are he/him, I'm 6 feet tall with a bit of a dad bod and short brown hair that is usually spiked up when I'm not wearing a ball cap.

I am working as a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead at Qualtrics on the Developer Experience and Tooling team. My current languages of choice are Go, Typescript, and Bash. I also have quite a bit of experience with C++, Python, C, and x86 Assembly.

My personal mission is to improve developer experiences and productivity across all of Qualtrics and ultimately for software engineers everywhere.

Prior to Qualtrics, I worked as a Software Security Engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. There I was focused on building applications and system integrations to support cyber resiliency R&D, experimentation, and execution.

I have a Master's degree in Information Security (MSIS) from Carnegie Mellon University, with an emphasis in system-level code security, reverse engineering, and exploitation. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Southern Utah University. However, beyond my degrees, I have always had a deep craving for knowledge, to which I attribute the lionâ€™s share of my most valuable experiences.

I'm also more than just my profession. I am married to a strong, amazing woman and we have two beautiful daughters. My other interests and hobbies include; personal knowlege managment/productivity, running and playing various tabletop RPGs, managing a small homelab, dabbling in indie game development, reading, and mountain biking.


## Where else can you find Me?

[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@cctechwiz) is my primary social network account and where you can find my more raw thoughts in real-time, as well as blog notifications.

[Gumroad](https://cctechwiz.gumroad.com/) is where I plan to make available more static/refined downloadable content, some free and some paid.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cctechwiz/) is where you can follow my professional journey and accomplishments, although I pretty much only used LinkedIn as an over-engineered CV.

[GitHub](https://github.com/cctechwiz) is where you can find my code project and things I'm playing with. All code there comes with an as-is guarantee and I try to license it as permissive as I can.
